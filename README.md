![infrastructure](/images/static.jpg)
The diagram above is a graphical representation of the infrastructure we will be setting up. We will be hosting our static website content on Amazon S3 bucket. Then, we will setup a custom domain name with AWS Route53 as our DNS, create SSL certificate to secure our content and finally, configure Cloudfront CDN for content caching and distribution.
